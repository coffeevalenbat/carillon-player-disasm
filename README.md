# Carillon Player
This is a dissasembly of [Aleksi Eeben](https://aleksieeben.wordpress.com/)'s Carillon Player, a Game Boy music engine focused on speed (0-3 Scanlines on CGB max). This dissasembly is based on what I believe is the latest version of Carillon Player, using a mix of the included example ROMs and the playback code present in Carillon Editor v1.2.

This repository is supposed to work less as a 100% matching dissasembly of Carillon and more as a documentation of the format and an easy to use/understand version of the source code, hopefully allowing for easier implementation in Homebrew.

**Right now this repository is still very WIP!**

# Format
For info on the Carillon Player format, see inside [docs](docs/).

# Compiling
Simply open you favorite command prompt / terminal, place yourself in this directory (the one the Makefile is located in), and run the command `make`.
This should create a bunch of things, including the output in the `bin` directory. 

To change the module to build, simply change `CARILLON_MODULE` in `project.mk` to target your desired file. Right now, the repository contains all the original example Carillon modules as .SAV files for playback. To enable/disable the sample player, simply comment out the line below it. Music that uses samples will work without it but will lack sample playback.

Pass the `-s` flag to `make` if it spews too much input for your tastes.
PÃ¤ss the `-j <N>` flag to `make` to build more things in parallel, replacing `<N>` with however many things you want to build in parallel; your number of (logical) CPU cores is often a good pick (so, `-j 8` for me), run the command `nproc` to obtain it.

If you get errors that you don't understand, try running `make clean`.
If that gives the same error, try deleting the `assets` directory.
If that still doesn't work, try deleting the `bin` and `obj` directories as well.
If that still doesn't work, feel free to ask for help.
